# Involuntary_care_home_closures
Welcome to a home for code and data needed to reproduce the data, analysis and figures published in the paper titled: "Involuntary closures of for-profit care homes by the Care 
Quality Commission" in the Lancet Healthy Longevity - authored by Dr Anders Bach-Mortensen, Ben Goodair, and Dr Michelle Degli Esposti.

Underlying data and Stata do files are provided for replication of the figures as per the paper. We have also roughly translated this to R for the sake of open access.
